Luvit Installer
===

Installation
-----

As simple as putting `lui` script under your `$PATH`. If you manage `luvit` installation via [luvm](https://github.com/dvv/luvit-luvm) this is done automatically.

Usage
-----

Move to your package root and type:

    lui

`Lui` analyzes package manifest, `package.lua`, if any, and installs package dependencies. For each installed module `lui` as well installs dependencies.
